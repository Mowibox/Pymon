# About the game
Pymon is a Python derivative of the game Simon where the objective is to memorize and reproduce sequences of random colors.

The unique aspect of Pymon is that the game interface is created using the player's computer camera, and color selection is done directly on the screen by hand detection.

Serial communication is established with the game box to retrieve player inputs.

# How to play? 
Clone this repository to your computer:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mowibox/Pymon.git
```
Connect the game device to your computer; a sound sequence should play if everything is working correctly.

Open the `main.py` file in the Python folder and install the libraries by using the requirements file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Have fun!
